    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;
**Connectable:** an abstract class that represents a thing (`Equipment`, `DomainSpace` or `Junction`) that can be connected via connection points and connections.

**Connection:** the modeling construct used to represent a physical thing (e.g., pipe, duct, or conductor) that is used to convey some `Substance-Medium` (e.g., water, air, or electricity) between two `Connectable` things.

**ConnectionPoint:** an abstract modeling construct used to represent the fact that one `Connectable` thing can be connected to another `Connectable` thing using a `Connection`. It is the abstract representation of the flange, wire terminal, or other physical feature where a connection is made.

**Domain:** a categorization of building service or specialization used to characterize equipment or spaces in a building. Example domains include HVAC, lighting, and plumbing.

**DomainSpace:** a portion or the entirety of a `PhysicalSpace` that is associated with a `EnumerationKind-Domain`, such as lighting, HVAC, or physical security. `DomainSpace`s can be combined to form a `Zone`.

**Equipment:** the modeling construct used to represent a device designed to accomplish a specific task. Examples include a pump, fan, heat exchanger, luminaire, temperature sensor, or flow meter. Both `Equipment` and `System` can be used to associate multiple pieces of `Equipment` with a higher-level concept. See {pub:equipment} and {pub:system} for clarification on the distinction between these concepts.

**Medium:** a substance used to convey mass, energy, or information through `Equipment` or a `System`.  Examples include air, water, refrigerant, and electricity.

**PhysicalSpace:** an architectural concept that represents a room, a collection of rooms such as a floor, a part of a room, or any physical space that might not even be thought of as a room, such as a patio.

Note: while the word &#34;system&#34; is used colloquially throughout this document (e.g., building system, control system), the `System` concept has a more formal definition than its colloquial usage.

**System:** a logical grouping or collection of `Equipment`, `Junction`, or other `System`s for some defined purpose. Example purposes include all the `Equipment` and `Junction`s that provide Domestic Hot Water service in a building, or all fire safety `Equipment` in a building that must be routinely inspected. A `System` cannot have a `ConnectionPoint`. See {pub:equipment} and {pub:system} for clarification on the distinction between these concepts.

**Zone:** a collection of `DomainSpace`s of a specific domain that are grouped together from the perspective of building services or controls.

    ns1:title &#34;CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR SEMANTIC MODELING OF BUILDING SYSTEMS AND DATA&#34; ;
    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;
This standard defines modeling constructs for use in creating a machine-readable representation of building systems, the building spaces that they serve,
and the measurement and control points used to provide a safe and comfortable environment for the building occupants. The standard can be considered a
toolkit of semantic building blocks and rules for using them to create a semantic model of a particular building or campus of buildings. The resulting model provides
a way for software applications to determine the relationships between the mechanical equipment in the building (i.e., AHU 1 gets chilled water from CH 3
and provides conditioned air to VAV Boxes 12 through 15 serving rooms on the third floor) and the meaning of measurements that are available
(i.e., T16 is a temperature sensor measuring the temperature of the air stream exiting AHU 1).

The model does not directly contain telemetric data about the real-time operation or past operation of the building systems. It does provide information
about the meaning or context of that data and defines external references that are used to point to a source of the data values, thus enabling analytics
 applications to find them. If the data source is a BACnet building automation and control system, the external reference contains the necessary information
 for analytic software to learn which BACnet device, object, and property corresponds to the desired piece of information. This enables construction of a BACnet
 message used to read the value.

These capabilities are achieved by applying concepts, standards, and query tools developed and deployed for information and data science applications outside the building domain. A primary commercial driver for developing these standards and tools is the Semantic Web, an extension of the World Wide Web that was created to make the semantic meaning of data accessible from the Internet machine readable.

This standard uses Resource Description Framework (RDF) (W3C) and its extended schema (RDFS) to represent the semantic ideas in the model. RDF is a general method for representing semantic ideas as of a triple. A triple consists of a subject, a predicate, and either a literal or an object. For example:

Jane hasFriend Dave

Jane hasSupervisor Mary

In this example, Jane is the subject of both triples, there are two different predicates, hasFriend and hasSupervisor, and there are two different objects,
 Dave and Mary. The number of triples is expanded as needed to capture the desired information. The collection of triples represents a directed
  multi-graph that can be searched or queried to answer questions or to infer information that may not be explicit in the graph. Figure 4-1 is a graph that
   corresponds to this example.

![Example triple graph.](figures/Figure_4-1_Triple_Example.svg)

This standard defines subjects, predicates, and objects relevant to the building space that are used to build a multi-graph representing a specific
 building or group of buildings. A compelling advantage of this graph-based approach is the ability to combine semantic graphs derived from complementary
 semantic models that apply to the same building. This makes it possible to take advantage of the combined information from distinct domains. For example, a
 RealEstateCore model that captures how spaces are assigned to different tenants in a building linked to the spaces represented in a Standard 223 model
 results in a semantic model containing the combined information. In a similar way, it is possible to link information from a computerized maintenance
 management system or an asset management system to the semantic graph of a Standard 223 model by adding a triple that binds a piece of equipment to its
 representation in the other system.

A model constructed from this standard describes the topology of the equipment and spaces in a building but not the geometric details. Linking a
Standard 223 model with an RDF representation of a building information model would add that geometric information.

Another advantage of using RDF to model building systems is that a query language standard, SPARQL (W3C SPARQL), exists and tools that implement SPARQL
are readily available. A building analytics tool developer needs only to create a library of queries relevant to their application, and use these queries
to interrogate any Standard 223 conformant model to find what they need from that building for their application.

Using RDF also provides a way to build conformance constraints into this standard in a way that enables conformance to be algorithmically verified.
This is done by using a different W3C standard, Shapes Constraints Language (SHACL) (W3C SHACL). SHACL defines a way to constrain the construction of RDF
graphs through the application of custom developed rules called shapes. The normative constraints described in this standard are formalized in
SHACL shapes. The description of each concept defined in this standard includes a table that lists related conformance constraints defined by these
SHACL shapes. Readily available SHACL reasoners check whether or not a particular model instance conforms to the shapes defined in this standard.

The concepts and relations mentioned below were designed to aid in standard development using RDF and SHACL exclusively and avoiding any dependence on OWL axioms.
This approach was chosen to avoid some of the shortcomings of using OWL in industrial settings, such as the open world assumption, the many flavors of OWL and their
support, and the sometimes counterintuitive implications of OWL reasoning for non-ontologists. (For example, if an instance satisfies the OWL axioms for a class, then
it is inferred to be an instance of that class). The use of SHACL shapes to define constraints and inferencing rules is a more intuitive way to define intended
model behavior and to verify conformance to the standard. The two most-used OWL inferences, supporting symmetric and inverse relations, are redefined in this standard
using SHACL rules.

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;In this standard, SHACL shapes are used to define conformance constraints.
When a SHACL reasoner is applied to a model, discrepancies from the conformance constraints result in a message from the reasoner with one of three levels
of severity (sh:severity).

A message with a severity sh:Info means that a model construct is incomplete.

A message with a severity sh:Warning means that a model construct is used in an unexpected way.

A message with a severity sh:Violation means a model construct is invalid and does not comply with the standard.&#34;&#34;&#34; .

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;SHACL is used in this standard to derive implicit information via a process called inferencing. Inference rules are used to define
how new triples are generated. The triples generated from this inference process enhance the ability to make useful queries without the burden of a modeler
crafting each one. The goal is to make model development easier without sacrificing the utility application developers need to find what they are looking
for. The description of each concept defined in this standard with related inference rules includes a table that lists the relevant SHACL shapes that specify
the inferencing.&#34;&#34;&#34; .

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;
The normative content of this standard is documented in an RDF model textualized using Turtle (see {pub:AnnexA}). All models conforming to this standard shall
be textualized using Turtle.

The Turtle serialization format specifies that IRIs may be written as relative or absolute IRIs or prefixed names. The prefix
label is defined by using the &#34;@prefix&#34; directive followed by a colon followed by a partial IRI. The encoding
examples used in this document assume the following prefix statements:

```turtle
@prefix s223: &lt;http://data.ashrae.org/standard223#&gt; .
@prefix bacnet: &lt;https://data.ashrae.org/bacnet/&gt; .
@prefix qudt: &lt;http://qudt.org/schema/qudt/&gt; .
```

A prefixed name is turned into an IRI by concatenating the IRI associated with the prefix and the local part. The &#39;@prefix&#39; directive associates
a prefix label with an IRI, e.g., `s223:Equipment` expands to `&lt;http://data.ashrae.org/standard223#Equipment&gt;`. The scope of a prefix label is only within
the Turtle file that it appears. It is encouraged to use the prefix statements above when exchanging models.&#34;&#34;&#34; .

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34; Because this standard includes references to measurements of physical properties, it is necessary to provide a model representation of
units of measure as well as what those units are quantifying (e.g. temperature, power, etc.). This standard builds upon the “Quantities, Units, Dimensions,
and Types” (QUDT) ontology which is an open-source model expressed in RDF/SHACL. The QUDT model is documented at [https://qudt.org](https://qudt.org). The key concepts
used here are the classes `qudt:Unit` and `qudt:QuantityKind`. The 223 standard is compatible with Version 3.1.1 of QUDT and is expected to be compatible with
all newer versions as well.&#34;&#34;&#34; .

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34; Because it is anticipated that models conforming to this standard
will be combined with other semantic models, it is necessary to define
a namespace for the concepts defined by this standard to avoid any possible ambiguities
that might arise from a similar name used in the complementary model. In this standard
and all conforming models, the prefix “s223:” shall be used in the name of each

In common usage, terms like equipment and system have a variety of ambiguous and possibly conflicting interpretations. A semantic model is an attempt to eliminate such ambiguities and conflicts. `Equipment` and `System` have unique definitions and use cases in this ontology. Both concepts can be used to associate multiple pieces of `Equipment` with a higher-level concept. This association is accomplished using unique predicates. A new instance of `Equipment` can be associated with other `Equipment` using the relation `contains` (see {pub:equipment-containment}). Note that `Equipment` is `Connectable` (see {pub:connectedness}) and the relation `contains` implies physical containment. Alternatively, a `System` can be associated with one or more instances of `Equipment`, `System` or `Junction` using the relation `hasMember` (see {pub:system}). Note that `System` is not `Connectable` (see {pub:connectedness}), the relation `hasMember` does not imply physical containment.The decision of whether to model a higher-level concept as an Equipment or a System is a modeler’s choice.

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;`Equipment` is the modeling construct used to represent a thing designed to accomplish a specific task, or a complex thing
that contains component pieces of `Equipment` that are connected to each other and work together to accomplish a task. `Equipment` can have
`Connection`s and `ConnectionPoint`s through which one or more kinds of medium (see {s223:Substance-Medium}) might flow. Examples of `Equipment` defined in this ontology include `Pump`, `Fan`, `AirHeatExchanger`, `Luminaire`, and `Sensor`. `Equipment` can be connected to other `Connectable`s such as other `Equipment` or `DomainSpace`s.

The graphical depiction of Equipment used in this document is a round-cornered rectangle as shown in Figure 5-1.

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;
A piece of equipment can only contain other pieces of equipment. For example, a fan
can be contained by an air handling unit. The relation `contains` is used to describe
a piece of equipment containing another piece of equipment (see {s223:contains}). The
relationship `mapsTo` relates a `ConnectionPoint` of a contained `Equipment` to the
`ConnectionPoint` of a containing `Equipment` (see {s223:mapsTo}). For example, the
air inlet to a heating coil contained in a fan coil unit may map to the air inlet
of the fan coil unit. Any air connection to the fan coil unit inlet is supplying
air to the inlet of the heating coil as well.

Multiple pieces of equipment contained by the same piece of equipment may connect
to each other, however, they may not connect to equipment that are not also contained.
To indicate how a contained piece of equipment connects to an external piece of
equipment, the relationship `mapsTo` is used. `mapsTo` will relate the connection
point of a contained equipment to the connection point of the containing equipment,
then the connection point of the containing equipment may connect to the external
equipment.

It may be desirable for a piece of containing equipment to have a `Property` that
has a value representing something that is associated with a contained piece of
equipment. For example, consider a fan coil unit that contains a fan and a coil.
The fan may have a `Property` that represents the speed of the fan. To make this fan
speed visible as a `Property` of the fan coil unit, a fan speed `Property` would be
added to the fan coil unit and its value would be an internal reference
(see {s223:hasInternalReference}) to the speed `Property` of the contained motor.

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;
A `Sensor` `observes` an `ObservableProperty` (see {s223:ObservableProperty})
which may be quantifiable (see {s223:QuantifiableObservableProperty}), such as a
temperature, flow, or concentration, or enumerable (see {s223:EnumeratedObservableProperty}),
such as an occupancy state.

If a `Sensor` observes a `QuantifiableObservableProperty` relative to an assumed
or common reference point, it can be modeled with only an observation location.
For example:

```turtle
@prefix : &lt;http://example.com/&gt; .

:example1 a s223:TemperatureSensor ;
    s223:hasObservationLocation :location1 ;
    qudt:hasQuantityKind quantitykind:Temperature .
```

If a `Sensor` observes a `QuantifiableObservableProperty` relative to a unique
or specified reference point, it can be modeled with an observation location and
a reference location, and indicating the difference between two values by setting `qudt:isDeltaQuantity` to `true`. For example:

```turtle
@prefix : &lt;http://example.com/&gt; .

:example2 a s223:TemperatureSensor ;
    s223:hasObservationLocation :location1 ;
    s223:hasReferenceLocation :location2 ;
    qudt:hasQuantityKind quantitykind:Temperature ;
    qudt:isDeltaQuantity true .
```

(see {s223:ConcentrationSensor}).

The 223 standard does not constrain the `Unit` or `QuantityKind` reported by a `ParticulateSensor`, but possible
`QuantityKind`s include `Density` (mass per volume), `ParticleNumberDensity` (count per volume), and `DimensionlessRatio` (with units such as `PPM` or
`PPB`). Some particulate sensors may claim to report a raw count of particles, for which a `QuantityKind` of `Count` could be used, but the required
context for such a measurement should be provided in the sensor&#39;s documentation to specify if it in fact measures a count per volume (e.g., `ParticleNumberDensity`),
time (e.g., `CountRate` or `ParticleCurrent`), or some
other combination. Explicitly declaring the `QuantityKind` of a sensor&#39;s output is preferable to relying on implicit assumptions.&#34;&#34;&#34; ;

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;A `ConnectionPoint` is an abstract modeling construct used to represent the fact that one connectable thing can be connected to another connectable thing using a `Connection`. It is the abstract representation of the flange, wire terminal, or other physical feature where a connection is made. `Equipment`, `DomainSpace`s and `Junction`s can have one or more `ConnectionPoint`s (see {s223:Connectable}).

A `ConnectionPoint` is constrained to relate to a specific medium such as air, water, or electricity which determines what other things can be connected to it. For example, constraining a `ConnectionPoint` to be for air means it cannot be used for an electrical connection.

A `ConnectionPoint` belongs to exactly one connectable thing (see {s223:Connectable}).

`ConnectionPoint`s are represented graphically in this standard by a triangle with the point indicating a direction of flow, or a diamond in the case of a bidirectional flow as shown in Figure 6-1.

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;A `Connection` is the modeling construct used to represent the thing (e.g., pipe, duct, conductor, or free space) that is used to convey
some Medium (e.g., water, air, electricity, light, Wi-Fi) between two connectable things. All connections have two or more connection points bound
to either `Equipment` (see {s223:Equipment}), `DomainSpace` (see {s223:DomainSpace}), or `Junction` (see {s223:Junction}). See Figure 6-2. If the direction
of flow is constrained, that constraint is indicated by using one or more `InletConnectionPoint`s (see {s223:InletConnectionPoint}) to represent the
inflow points and `OutletConnectionPoint`s (see {s223:OutletConnectionPoint}) to represent the outflow points.

A `Connection` may contain branches or intersections. These may be modeled using `Junction`s if it is necessary to identify a specific intersection.
(see {s223:Junction}).

The constraint to maintain compatible mediums among a `Connection` and all of its associated `ConnectionPoint`s gives rise to multiple
validation test cases, where the specified medium might be a pure medium, or a mixture with constituents. See {s223:Substance-Medium} for
more details.

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;A `Junction` is a modeling construct used when a branching point within a `Connection` (see {s223:Connection}) is of significance,
such as specifying the observation location of a `Sensor`, or when a modeler wants to expose a branch point within a containing piece of `Equipment`.
When a `Junction` is used, what might have been modeled as a single, branched `Connection`
is separated into three or more separate connections, all tied together with the `Junction` and its associated connection points.

`Junction` is a subclass of `Connectable`, which gives it the ability to have connection points, but unlike `Equipment` (and like `Connection`)
it is not allowed to change the `Substance-Medium` that passes through it. This is why `Junction` is a sibling class to `Equipment` and not a subclass.
This constraint to maintain compatible mediums among a `Junction` and all of its associated `ConnectionPoint`s gives rise to multiple
validation test cases, where the specified medium might be a pure medium, or a mixture with constituents (see {s223:Substance-Medium}).&#34;&#34;&#34; ;

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;
The collection of relations defined for `Connectable`, `ConnectionPoint`, and `Connection`
is intended to facilitate model queries that answer questions about how equipment
is connected and to what it is connected. These relations are shown in Figure 6-3.

![Connection Relations.](figures/Figure_6-1_Connection_Relationships.svg)

It is not necessary for a model developer to create each of these relations individually.
A model can be created using a simpler construct shown in Figure 6-4 using the
`cnx` relation. Inference rules can then be applied to generate the complete set
shown in Figure 6-3. The intent is to simplify model development without losing
the connectedness relationships that facilitate model queries.

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;In common usage, terms like equipment and system have a variety of ambiguous and possibly conflicting interpretations. A semantic model is an attempt to eliminate such ambiguities and conflicts. `Equipment` and `System` have unique definitions and use cases in this ontology. Both concepts can be used to associate multiple pieces of `Equipment` with a higher-level concept. This association is accomplished using unique predicates. A new instance of `Equipment` can be associated with other `Equipment` using the relation `contains` (see {pub:equipment-containment}). Note that `Equipment` is `Connectable` (see {pub:connectedness}) and the relation `contains` implies physical containment. Alternatively, a `System` can be associated with one or more instances of `Equipment`, `System` or `Junction` using the relation `hasMember` (see {pub:system}). Note that `System` is not `Connectable` (see {pub:connectedness}), the relation `hasMember` does not imply physical containment.The decision of whether to model a higher-level concept as an Equipment or a System is a modeler’s choice.

    rdfs:comment &#34;The `hasBoundaryConnectionPoint` relation means the `ConnectionPoint` represents the boundary of a `System` (see {s223:System}) defined by the modeler, such as a model fragment provided by the vendor of a collection of equipment intended for integration with another model. The presence of this relation is used to indicate that such a \&#34;dangling connection point\&#34; should not generate a validation error in a non-integrated context but should generate an error in an integrated context.&#34; .

There are two types of spaces: `PhysicalSpace`and `DomainSpace`. `PhysicalSpace`s represent the building from the architectural and occupant perspective. A `PhysicalSpace` may represent a room (e.g., an office or conference room), a part of a room (e.g., a foyer), a collection of rooms (e.g., a floor or the entire building), or any other physical region in a building (e.g., a patio or a roof), or a whole campus.

A `DomainSpace` is a subclass of `Connectable` (see {s223:Connectable}) that represents some portion of a `PhysicalSpace` that is affected by a building service associated with a particular domain (e.g., HVAC, lighting, see {s223:EnumerationKind-Domain}). `DomainSpace`s can be viewed as the endpoints of building services.

`DomainSpace`s can represent an entire `PhysicalSpace` or a portion of a `PhysicalSpace`, and thus `PhysicalSpace`s enclose `DomainSpace`s. An instance of a `PhysicalSpace` may enclose `DomainSpace`s from different domains, and may also enclose multiple `DomainSpace`s of the same domain. For example, a `PhysicalSpace` may represent an office that `encloses` a single HVAC `DomainSpace` and multiple lighting `DomainSpace`s. This would indicate a single HVAC service is provided to the office, along with multiple lighting services (e.g., one that provides lighting to the area of the office that receives daylight, and another that provides lighting to the area of the office that does not receive daylight). Multiple `DomainSpace`s of the same domain may overlap. For example, a `DomainSpace` affected by lighting devices that provide general lighting service to a room may overlap with the  `DomainSpace` affected by the lighting devices that provide emergency lighting service to a room.&#34;&#34;&#34; .

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;Enumerations are sets of values that are closed (they cannot take on values outside of what is explicitly listed in the definition) and named (each value has a unique name). The values within an enumeration share a &#34;kind,&#34; which communicates how the enumerations are intended to be used.

The standard uses enumerations to convey groups of useful values for describing attributes of things e.g., Properties, `Equipment`.&#34;&#34;&#34; .

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;This is the encapsulating class for all `EnumerationKind`s.
`EnumerationKind`s define the (closed) set of permissible values for a given purpose.
For example, `EnumerationKind-DayOfWeek` enumerates the days of the week and allows no other values.

`EnumerationKind`s are arranged in a class hierarchy tree, with the root class named `EnumerationKind`. Each subclass is named
starting with its immediate superclass, followed by a hyphen and a name that is unique among the sibling classes.
Each class is also an instance of itself. This unusual modeling pattern was used to achieve:

- The ability to set an `EnumerationKind` value that is more general, or not yet fully specified
  at the time of modeling, such as `Electricity-AC` without having to state exactly what voltage or frequency it is.

- The ability to use the `sh:class` SHACL predicate at any level in the `EnumerationKind` hierarchy
  to constrain a value in the s223 specification, even if it is a more general one such as `Electricity-AC` in the above example.

Certain validation constraints exist in the standard that evaluate compatibility of `EnumerationKind`s.
Two values are deemed compatible if they are the same, if one is a direct ancestor (or descendant) of the other,
or if they are mixtures sharing at least one constituent.&#34;&#34;&#34; ;

Numerical enumeration kinds are used to support the definitions of the
`Constituent-Electricity`. The enumerations instances in these classes have names that
are recognizable by humans but are just a string for a computer application. To
avoid the need to parse strings, each of these `EnumerationKind`s have
relations with the `EnumerationKind`s that represent electrical
phase, voltage, and frequency. The purpose of these properties is to enable a
machine to query them and obtain the same information that a person would
associate with the string.

relief, and return. These enumeration kinds are intended to indicate the capability of an entity to play a given
role, rather than the role being actively played at any given point in time. For example,
a reversible piece of equipment might play a role of `Role-Cooling` at one time, and `Role-Heating` at another time.
Such an entity would be modeled using the `hasRole` relation with both role values. The active role at a particular time can be modeled as a `Property` with
an `ExternalReference` to telemetry data.

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;This class and its enumerated subclasses represent substances that facilitate the conveyance of matter, energy, or information.  It is used to qualify `Connection`s and `ConnectionPoint`s with the relation `hasMedium` (see {s223:hasMedium}).

`Substance-Medium` is also the root of the medium hierarchy that is used to ensure compatibility of different medium designations. For example,
`Fluid-Water` and `Water-ChilledWater` are alternative but compatible ways of identifying what is flowing in a pipe, using different degrees of
specificity. `Water-ChilledWater` and `Water-HotWater` are not compatible. Compatibility is determined by testing if one medium is a subclass of the
other. This gets a bit more complicated in the case of mixtures, where at least one of the constituents of a mixture must be compatible with at least one of
the constituents of the other medium.

Testing for medium compatibility is done in the context of entities that have a `hasMedium` relation, such as

* `Connection` and its associated `ConnectionPoint`s. See {s223:Connection}.

* `Junction` and its associated `ConnectionPoint`s See {s223:Junction}.

* `Filter` and its associated `ConnectionPoint`s. See {s223:Filter}.

* Any `Concept` that has a `hasMedium` relation, compared with an associated `Property` with an `ofMedium` relation. See {s223:Concept}.

These tests are listed in the constraint tables for the respective classes listed above, identified as Case 1, Case 2, etc.

This class and its subclasses represent substances that are composed of constituents. The components of a `Medium-Mix` can be modeled using the relations `composedOf` and `ofConstituent`. See Figure 10-8a and Figure 10-8b.

Figure 10-8a shows `GlycolSolution-30Percent`, itself a subclass of
`Water-GlycolSolution`, `Fluid-Water`, and `Mix-Fluid`, with a _Water Concentration_
property referencing 70% `Constituent-H2O` by the relation `ofConstituent` and
a _Glycol Concentration_ property referencing 30% `Constituent-Glycol` also
by the relation `ofConstituent`.

Figure 10-8b shows `PowerAndSignal-PoE`, itself a subclass of `Mix-PowerAndSignal`,
composed of a _Power_ `Property` referencing `Electricity-DC` and a _Communications_
`Property` referencing `Signal-WiredEthernet`.

Figure 10-9 shows an instance of a `Connection` with `hasMedium` referencing
`Fluid-Air` that has a `Property` _Particulate Concentration_ of particles with a
diameter of 2.5 micrometres (0.0025 mm) or smaller in units of micrograms per
cubic meter.

![Carbon Monoxide Concentration](figures/Figure_x-y_Medium_Concentration.svg)

Figure 10-10 shows an instance of a `Property` _CO Concentration_ with `ofSubstance`
referencing carbon monoxide `Constituent-CO` and `ofMedium` referencing `Fluid-Air`
measured in parts-per-million.  This figure also shows that the value of this
`Property` can be obtained by using the BACnet protocol via the external reference
to get the `present-value` of `analog-value,67` in the device with an instance
number `12345`.

The `Property` class is the parent of all variations of a `Property`, which are:

- `ActuatableProperty`, a subclass of `Property` that can be modified by user or machine outside of the model (typically command);
- `ObservableProperty`, a subclass of `Property` that are observed (typically measures);
- `EnumerableProperty`, a subclass of `Property` defined by `EnumerationKind`; and
- `QuantifiableProperty`, a subclass of `Property` defined by numerical values.

And their subclass combinations:

- `QuantifiableActuatableProperty`,
- `QuantifiableObservableProperty`,
- `EnumeratedObservableProperty`, and
- `EnumeratedActuatableProperty`.

A `QuantifiableProperty` (or subclass thereof) shall always be associated with a `Unit` and a `QuantityKind`, either explicitly from the `Property`,
or through the associated Value. If the `Unit` is defined, the SHACL reasoner (if invoked) will figure out and assert a `QuantityKind` if it is
unambiguous.

Enumerable properties shall be associated with an `EnumerationKind`. Different flavors of properties are shown in Figure 11-1.

    rdfs:comment &#34;A `Relation` that associates a `Property` being observed by a `Sensor` with the `EnumerationKind-Substance` it characterizes within a specific `Substance-Medium`. For example, to denote the concentration of a `EnumerationKind-Substance` in a `Substance-Medium`, `ofSubstance` is used. Typically, there is also an `ofMedium` relation between the observed `Property` and the `Substance-Medium`, (see Figures 10-9 and 10-10). For example, to represent the concentration of CO2 in air, we use `ofSubstance` to relate to CO2 and `ofMedium` to relate to air. The term `ofSubstance` is broad enough to include situations where a sensor is used to detect constituents that should not be present in a medium, such as ammonia in air. Therefore, `ofSubstance` is used to indicate the substance of interest, while `ofConstituent` would indicate a constituent that is normally present in the composition of the mix.&#34; .

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;This extension uses the concepts defined in the 223 standard to model the ASHRAE Guideline 36 data requirements for air-side equipment, defined in Section 4 of ASHRAE Guideline 36-2024.
These requirements are modeled as classes that use SHACL constraints to define how the equipment should be modeled in 223, focusing on the data points needed for Guideline 36 control sequences.
These classes can be used to ensure that a model has the metadata necessary to support Guideline 36 sequences. They can be used to validate existing models against the requirements of Guideline 36 or to support modeling of compliant systems.
They can also be used to create templates or support tooling that creates models to match the defined constraints.
We have also included SHACL inference rules to infer labels for equipment within an existing 223 model, where modeling of the equipment satisfies the constraints defined for the Guideline 36 classes.
This can support querying and semantic interoperability between models created with and without use of this extension.
Additionally, this section includes example models of the systems presented in the Informative Appendix A of Guideline 36.
This content is intended to serve as an example of how the 223 standard can be extended to create higher level classes specific to an application, that can be useful for both validation and inference.
It is also intended to provide examples of how equipment can be modeled using 223.

    rdfs:comment &#34;&#34;&#34;
This section describes the classes representing common components used in this extension.
These components are not directly defined within Section 4 of Guideline 36, but are shared between the many systems described.
For example, g36:VAVTerminalCoolingOnly (see {g36:VAVTerminalCoolingOnly}),
g36:VAVTerminalWithReheat (see {g36:VAVTerminalWithReheat}),
g36:FanPoweredTerminal (see {g36:FanPoweredTerminal}),
g36:DualDuctTerminalWithInletSensors (see {g36:DualDuctTerminalWithInletSensors}),
and g36:DualDuctTerminalWithDischargeSensor (see {g36:DualDuctTerminalWithDischargeSensor})
all share requirements for what properties a Zone must have.
The Guideline 36 classes defined in subsequent sections are composed of the following components.
