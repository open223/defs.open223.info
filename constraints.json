The standard can be considered a\ntoolkit of semantic building blocks and rules for using them to create a semantic model of a particular building or campus of buildings. The resulting model provides\na way for software applications to determine the relationships between the mechanical equipment in the building (i.e., AHU 1 gets chilled water from CH 3\nand provides conditioned air to VAV Boxes 12 through 15 serving rooms on the third floor) and the meaning of measurements that are available\n(i.e., T16 is a temperature sensor measuring the temperature of the air stream exiting AHU 1).\n\nThe model does not directly contain telemetric data about the real-time operation or past operation of the building systems. It does provide information\nabout the meaning or context of that data and defines external references that are used to point to a source of the data values, thus enabling analytics\n applications to find them. If the data source is a BACnet building automation and control system, the external reference contains the necessary information\n for analytic software to learn which BACnet device, object, and property corresponds to the desired piece of information. This enables construction of a BACnet\n message used to read the value.\n\nThese capabilities are achieved by applying concepts, standards, and query tools developed and deployed for information and data science applications outside the building domain. A primary commercial driver for developing these standards and tools is the Semantic Web, an extension of the World Wide Web that was created to make the semantic meaning of data accessible from the Internet machine readable.\n\nThis standard uses Resource Description Framework (RDF) (W3C) and its extended schema (RDFS) to represent the semantic ideas in the model. RDF is a general method for representing semantic ideas as of a triple. A triple consists of a subject, a predicate, and either a literal or an object. For example:\n\nJane hasFriend Dave\n\nJane hasSupervisor Mary\n\nIn this example, Jane is the subject of both triples, there are two different predicates, hasFriend and hasSupervisor, and there are two different objects,\n Dave and Mary. The number of triples is expanded as needed to capture the desired information. The collection of triples represents a directed\n  multi-graph that can be searched or queried to answer questions or to infer information that may not be explicit in the graph. Figure 4-1 is a graph that\n   corresponds to this example.\n\n![Example triple graph.](figures/Figure_4-1_Triple_Example.svg)\n\nThis standard defines subjects, predicates, and objects relevant to the building space that are used to build a multi-graph representing a specific\n building or group of buildings. A compelling advantage of this graph-based approach is the ability to combine semantic graphs derived from complementary\n semantic models that apply to the same building. This makes it possible to take advantage of the combined information from distinct domains. For example, a\n RealEstateCore model that captures how spaces are assigned to different tenants in a building linked to the spaces represented in a Standard 223 model\n results in a semantic model containing the combined information. In a similar way, it is possible to link information from a computerized maintenance\n management system or an asset management system to the semantic graph of a Standard 223 model by adding a triple that binds a piece of equipment to its\n representation in the other system.\n\nA model constructed from this standard describes the topology of the equipment and spaces in a building but not the geometric details. Linking a\nStandard 223 model with an RDF representation of a building information model would add that geometric information.\n\nAnother advantage of using RDF to model building systems is that a query language standard, SPARQL (W3C SPARQL), exists and tools that implement SPARQL\nare readily available. A building analytics tool developer needs only to create a library of queries relevant to their application, and use these queries\nto interrogate any Standard 223 conformant model to find what they need from that building for their application.\n\nUsing RDF also provides a way to build conformance constraints into this standard in a way that enables conformance to be algorithmically verified.\nThis is done by using a different W3C standard, Shapes Constraints Language (SHACL) (W3C SHACL). SHACL defines a way to constrain the construction of RDF\ngraphs through the application of custom developed rules called shapes. The normative constraints described in this standard are formalized in\nSHACL shapes. The description of each concept defined in this standard includes a table that lists related conformance constraints defined by these\nSHACL shapes. Readily available SHACL reasoners check whether or not a particular model instance conforms to the shapes defined in this standard.\n\nThe concepts and relations mentioned below were designed to aid in standard development using RDF and SHACL exclusively and avoiding any dependence on OWL axioms.\nThis approach was chosen to avoid some of the shortcomings of using OWL in industrial settings, such as the open world assumption, the many flavors of OWL and their\nsupport, and the sometimes counterintuitive implications of OWL reasoning for non-ontologists. (For example, if an instance satisfies the OWL axioms for a class, then\nit is inferred to be an instance of that class). The use of SHACL shapes to define constraints and inferencing rules is a more intuitive way to define intended\nmodel behavior and to verify conformance to the standard. The two most-used OWL inferences, supporting symmetric and inverse relations, are redefined in this standard\nusing SHACL rules.\n\"\"\" .\n\n",

A new instance of `Equipment` can be associated with other `Equipment` using the relation `contains` (see {pub:equipment-containment}).

For example, a fan\ncan be contained by an air handling unit. The relation `contains` is used to describe\na piece of equipment containing another piece of equipment (see {s223:contains}). The\nrelationship `mapsTo` relates a `ConnectionPoint` of a contained `Equipment` to the\n`ConnectionPoint` of a containing `Equipment` (see {s223:mapsTo}). For example, the\nair inlet to a heating coil contained in a fan coil unit may map to the air inlet\nof the fan coil unit. Any air connection to the fan coil unit inlet is supplying\nair to the inlet of the heating coil as well.\n\nMultiple pieces of equipment contained by the same piece of equipment may connect\nto each other, however, they may not connect to equipment that are not also contained.\nTo indicate how a contained piece of equipment connects to an external piece of\nequipment, the relationship `mapsTo` is used. `mapsTo` will relate the connection\npoint of a contained equipment to the connection point of the containing equipment,\nthen the connection point of the containing equipment may connect to the external\nequipment.\n\nIt may be desirable for a piece of containing equipment to have a `Property` that\nhas a value representing something that is associated with a contained piece of\nequipment. For example, consider a fan coil unit that contains a fan and a coil.\nThe fan may have a `Property` that represents the speed of the fan. To make this fan\nspeed visible as a `Property` of the fan coil unit, a fan speed `Property` would be\nadded to the fan coil unit and its value would be an internal reference\n(see {s223:hasInternalReference}) to the speed `Property` of the contained motor.\n\"\"\" .\n\n",

All connections have two or more connection points bound\nto either `Equipment` (see {s223:Equipment}), `DomainSpace` (see {s223:DomainSpace}), or `Junction` (see {s223:Junction}). See Figure 6-2. If the direction\nof flow is constrained, that constraint is indicated by using one or more `InletConnectionPoint`s (see {s223:InletConnectionPoint}) to represent the\ninflow points and `OutletConnectionPoint`s (see {s223:OutletConnectionPoint}) to represent the outflow points.\n\nA `Connection` may contain branches or intersections. These may be modeled using `Junction`s if it is necessary to identify a specific intersection.\n(see {s223:Junction}).\n\nThe constraint to maintain compatible mediums among a `Connection` and all of its associated `ConnectionPoint`s gives rise to multiple\nvalidation test cases, where the specified medium might be a pure medium, or a mixture with constituents.

A `PhysicalSpace` may represent a room (e.g., an office or conference room), a part of a room (e.g., a foyer), a collection of rooms (e.g., a floor or the entire building), or any other physical region in a building (e.g., a patio or a roof), or a whole campus.\n\nA `DomainSpace` is a subclass of `Connectable` (see {s223:Connectable}) that represents some portion of a `PhysicalSpace` that is affected by a building service associated with a particular domain (e.g., HVAC, lighting, see {s223:EnumerationKind-Domain}). `DomainSpace`s can be viewed as the endpoints of building services.\n\n`DomainSpace`s can represent an entire `PhysicalSpace` or a portion of a `PhysicalSpace`, and thus `PhysicalSpace`s enclose `DomainSpace`s. An instance of a `PhysicalSpace` may enclose `DomainSpace`s from different domains, and may also enclose multiple `DomainSpace`s of the same domain. For example, a `PhysicalSpace` may represent an office that `encloses` a single HVAC `DomainSpace` and multiple lighting `DomainSpace`s. This would indicate a single HVAC service is provided to the office, along with multiple lighting services (e.g., one that provides lighting to the area of the office that receives daylight, and another that provides lighting to the area of the office that does not receive daylight). Multiple `DomainSpace`s of the same domain may overlap. For example, a `DomainSpace` affected by lighting devices that provide general lighting service to a room may overlap with the  `DomainSpace` affected by the lighting devices that provide emergency lighting service to a room.\"\"\" .\n\n",

It is used to qualify `Connection`s and `ConnectionPoint`s with the relation `hasMedium` (see {s223:hasMedium}).\n\n`Substance-Medium` is also the root of the medium hierarchy that is used to ensure compatibility of different medium designations. For example,\n`Fluid-Water` and `Water-ChilledWater` are alternative but compatible ways of identifying what is flowing in a pipe, using different degrees of\nspecificity. `Water-ChilledWater` and `Water-HotWater` are not compatible. Compatibility is determined by testing if one medium is a subclass of the\nother. This gets a bit more complicated in the case of mixtures, where at least one of the constituents of a mixture must be compatible with at least one of\nthe constituents of the other medium.\n\nTesting for medium compatibility is done in the context of entities that have a `hasMedium` relation, such as\n\n* `Connection` and its associated `ConnectionPoint`s. See {s223:Connection}.\n\n* `Junction` and its associated `ConnectionPoint`s See {s223:Junction}.\n\n* `Filter` and its associated `ConnectionPoint`s.

For example, to denote the concentration of a `EnumerationKind-Substance` in a `Substance-Medium`, `ofSubstance` is used. Typically, there is also an `ofMedium` relation between the observed `Property` and the `Substance-Medium`, (see Figures 10-9 and 10-10). For example, to represent the concentration of CO2 in air, we use `ofSubstance` to relate to CO2 and `ofMedium` to relate to air. The term `ofSubstance` is broad enough to include situations where a sensor is used to detect constituents that should not be present in a medium, such as ammonia in air.

They can be used to validate existing models against the requirements of Guideline 36 or to support modeling of compliant systems.\nThey can also be used to create templates or support tooling that creates models to match the defined constraints.\nWe have also included SHACL inference rules to infer labels for equipment within an existing 223 model, where modeling of the equipment satisfies the constraints defined for the Guideline 36 classes.\nThis can support querying and semantic interoperability between models created with and without use of this extension.\nAdditionally, this section includes example models of the systems presented in the Informative Appendix A of Guideline 36.\nThis content is intended to serve as an example of how the 223 standard can be extended to create higher level classes specific to an application, that can be useful for both validation and inference.\nIt is also intended to provide examples of how equipment can be modeled using 223.\n\"\"\" .\n\n",
